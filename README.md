# üìö Online Book Library Web Application

## Description

**An online book library that allows users to sign up as authors and add books to the platform. Users can preview other authors, rate, review, and preview books from other authors, as well as search and add books to their reading-list. üìñ‚ú®** üìñ‚ú®

## Technologies and Languages

- **Programming Language:** TypeScript | JavaScript
- **Frontend Framework:** React & Next.js
- **Dev Tools & Libraries:** React Query, Redux
- **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS & Mantine Component Library
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js 
- **Database:** MongoDB utilizing Mongoose

## Project Structure

Next.js API routes were used to set up the backend services, utilizing pages as API routes. All source code, including tests, are in the `src` directory following a consistent and simple folder structure to ensure scalability and readability for developers. üóÇÔ∏èüìÇ

## Deployment and Hosting

- **Project URL:** [Bookie](https://bookie-psi.vercel.app/)
- **GitHub Repository:** [Bookie GitHub Repo](https://github.com/stephenwayar/bookie.git)

The MongoDB URI and other environment variables are shared privately for security reasons. The database is hosted remotely. Starting the development server and making API requests by interacting with the app automatically connects to the remote database. üöÄüåê

## Running the App in Development

1. Add the provided environment variables to the `.env.local` file at the root of the project.
2. Run `npm install` to install packages.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server. üõ†Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüíª
